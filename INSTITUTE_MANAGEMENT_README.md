## Data Validation

### Backend Validation
- Required field validation
- Unique constraints on IDs and emails
- Minimum value validation for duration and fees

### Frontend Validation
- Form field validation
- Email format validation
- Number input validation
- Date picker constraints

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling in controllers
- User-friendly error messages in frontend
- Network error handling with axios
- Validation error display in forms

## Security Features

- Input sanitization
- Error message standardization
- Protected routes (existing authentication)
- CORS configuration maintained

## Testing the Features

1. **Start both servers** (backend on :3001, frontend on :3000)
2. **Login** with existing credentials
3. **Navigate to Dashboard** and use the new module buttons
4. **Test CRUD operations** for each module:
   - Create sample courses first
   - Add students and faculties
   - Create batches with relationships
   - Test edit and delete operations

## Database Migration

No migration is required as the new collections will be created automatically when first accessed. The existing database structure remains unchanged.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 3001 are available
2. **MongoDB connection**: Verify MongoDB is running and accessible
3. **CORS errors**: Check backend CORS configuration
4. **Missing data**: Ensure courses are created before creating students/faculties/batches

### Error Messages
- "Course not found": Ensure course exists before referencing
- "Duplicate key error": Check for unique constraint violations
- "Validation error": Verify all required fields are provided

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that can be added:
1. **Reporting**: Generate reports for courses, students, and batches
2. **Search & Filter**: Add search functionality to all modules
3. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export data via CSV
4. **Notifications**: Email notifications for batch assignments
5. **Calendar Integration**: Visual calendar for batch schedules
6. **Performance Metrics**: Track student progress and course completion

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the new features:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify API endpoints are responding correctly
3. Ensure all required fields are provided in forms
4. Check network connectivity between frontend and backend
